The last error that occurred in this project was related to the moviepy library being unable to process a file. The filename gu90um3z4yutm_medium=email&utm_source=singlestore&utm_campaign=7014X0000029aK5QAI&campaignid=7014X suggests that the file you're trying to download and process is not a video file.

The download_video function in your script is designed to download a file from a given URL and save it with the name taken from the last part of the URL. However, it seems like the URL you're using doesn't point to a video file.

You need to make sure that the URL you're using points directly to a video file. The URL should end with the video file's extension, such as .mp4 or .avi.

If you're trying to download a video from a website like YouTube, you can't do it by simply using the video's URL. These websites usually require a more complex process to download videos, which your current script doesn't support. In that case, you might need to use a library like youtube_dl or a similar tool.
